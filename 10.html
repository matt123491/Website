   <h3>Windows Vista</h3>
   <p><h3>Windows Vista was one of the worst OS's Microsoft has released most people said. 
       Windows Vista relased on 2006 on the outside wasn't that good but on the inside it brought much visual improvements to the Windows opperating system much seen in Windows 7. 
    "The problem was that it was "too advanced for it's time." 
    Companies didn't have enough time to update their drivers in time before it was released.
Microsoft also faced a lawsuit in 2008 over "Vista capable computers when they weren't and Microsoft was not in favor(or lost)"
People say that Windows Vista was bad due to Microsft. Instead of companies just not updating their drivers.

   <h3>Windows 7</h3>
   <p><h3>Windows 7 released in 2009 was the predecessor to Windows Vista.
       It was very similar to Windows Vista but came out a better time when drivers had time to update.
       Windows Vista ened support for all updates in early January 2020.
       Windows 7 still holds 11.99% of marketshare. <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" target="_blank">Windows 7 market share</a> It has been 13 years of the day this was made.

 <div id="Windows 8" class="tabcontent"> <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="topright">&times</span>
   <h3>Windows 8</h3>
   <p><h3>Windows 8 was relased on 2013.
       It was announced in 2012 that it can run on ARM devices(tablets)whhyich sounds great right?

       That's right. It was cool at the time but not for desktop or PC users.
       Windows 8 got rid of the start button and desktop in favor for all screen. 
       Most people who bought it went back to Windows 7 or didn't update at all.
       Windows then made Windows 8.1 later which fixed some of the issues people were facing like no start button and now you get the option to boot into the desktop.
      But still... It didn't reach the amount of success that Microsoft wanted since it was a release.
